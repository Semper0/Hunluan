# Hunluan
Hunluan is a survival simulator which uses abstract representations of hunger, health, and equipment in order to simulate an enviornment in which actors attempt to survive. Three small groups of three species compete in order to obtain the most food and resources. These species are: Humans, Elves, and Orcs. The main systems used to simulate survival are as follows: Hunger, Combat and decision making. Each agent decides what to do based on scenario. The game functions off of a turn based system, in which one turn is equal to ten minutes. This time interval will have to be tweaked over time, as if a turn is too long actors might not be able to do much other than scramble for food, or even starve to death in masse. If its too short, actors won't get hungry fast enough to pressure them to compete and adapt.
